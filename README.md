# Learning Goals:

Use Constructer Function

Use Objects

Use Google's Firebase Realtime Database

# Todos: 

Define rules for Database - after 30 days there is no longer public access to database

Make library faster - if there is a book added or deleted every book is refreshed - refresh only book deleted or created 

Style library nicer - put "New Book"-Button on Top - and more

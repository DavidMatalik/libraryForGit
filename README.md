# library

Todos: 

1. Define rules for Database. After 30 days there is no longer public access to database. 

2. Make library faster: At the moment if there is a book added or deleted every book is loaded fresh. Would be better if only with the book deleted or created something is done in the background.

3. Style library nicer: Put "New Book"-Button on Top.
